# Sentiment analysis of Yelp reviews
Yelp, an American multinational company was founded in 2004 and it crowd-sources reviews about businesses. Additionally, it also operates other domains: Yelp Reservations. As of December 2020, approximately 206.3 million reviews were available. The dataset is a subset of Yelp's business, reviews and user data.

The data consists of 5261668 observations and 11 columns. The dataset is available at:Kaggle. Each observation in this dataset is a review given by a particular user regarding a business. The major focus is with the 'stars' and 'text' columns. The 'stars' column is the number of stars ratings(1 to 5) given by the reviewer. The 'text' column includes the review given by the reviewer.

So,using this datasets this NLP project I have tried to find the sentiment of the review(in text) and assign either that belongs to 1 star or 5 star ratings.
